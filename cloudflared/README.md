Connect remotely to your Home Assistant instance without opening any ports using
Cloudflared.

## About

Cloudflared connects your Home Assistant Instance via a secure tunnel to a domain
or subdomain at Cloudflare. Doing that, you can expose your Home Assistant to the
Internet without opening ports in your router. Additionally, you can utilize
Cloudflare Teams, their Zero Trust platform to further secure your Home Assistant
connection.

**To use this app (add-on), you have to own a domain name (e.g. example.com) that is
using Cloudflare for its DNS entries. You can find more information about that
in our [Wiki][wiki]**.

## Disclaimer

Please make sure to be compliant with the
[Cloudflare Self-Serve Subscription Agreement][cloudflare-sssa] when using this
app (add-on).
